Currently, the most popular system for sharing files is another peer-to-peer network called Gnutella, or the Gnutella network. There are two main similarities between Gnutella and the old Napster:

Users place the files they want to share on their hard disks and make them available to everyone else for downloading in **peer-to-peer** fashion.
Users run a piece of **Gnutella software** to connect to the Gnutella network.
There are also two big differences between Gnutella and the old Napster:
- There is **no central database** that knows all of the files available on the Gnutella network. Instead, all of the machines on the network tell each other about available files using a distributed query approach.
- There are **many different client applications** available to access the Gnutella network.

Because of both of these features, it would be difficult for a simple court order to shut Gnutella down. The court would have to find a way to block all Gnutella network traffic at the ISP and the backbone levels of the Internet to stop people from sharing.
